# ShowcaseLeanTechniques
Internship showcase, for Lean Techniques. The game is Money counting, yippee! The user must enter any amount of money with 2 decimal places. Then the change must come back as the lowest amount  back.
# Showcase Exact Change

Welcome to Showcase Exact Change! This simple application takes any amount of money as input and responds with the minimum number of US currency units needed to represent that amount.

## Must-Haves

- **User Input:**
  - Users can input any amount of money with up to two decimal places.

- **Change Calculation:**
  - The application will respond with the amount in units of US currency with the least amount of change given.

  **Example:**
  ```plaintext
  Input: $19.99
  Output:
  - 1 x $10 bill
  - 1 x $5 bill
  - 4 x $1 bill
  - 3 x quarters
  - 2 x dimes
  - 4 x pennies

Conditions
Programming Language:

Python
Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

PyCharm
User Input Collection:

User input can be collected through any means - UI, file, terminal, etc.

I also like this program because you ask the user to enter any amount of change
The output will have the CORRECT change back in the form of Bills and Coins. 

# Showcase Exact Change

Welcome to Showcase Exact Change! This simple Python program calculates the minimum number of bills and coins needed to represent a given amount of money.

## How It Works

The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to input an amount, calculate the change, and display the minimum number of bills and coins required. The user can choose to try again or exit the program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/showcase-exact-change.git
    cd showcase-exact-change
    ```

2. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python exact_change.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Enter the amount of money when prompted (with up to two decimal places).

2. The program will display the minimum number of bills and coins needed to represent that amount.

3. You will be asked if you want to try again. Respond with 'yes' to input another amount or 'no' to exit the program.

## Example

Suppose you input $49.99. The program might output:

```plaintext
4 - $10 bill
2 - $5 bill
4 - $1 bill
3 - quarters
2 - dimes
4 - pennies
